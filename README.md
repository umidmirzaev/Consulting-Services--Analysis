# Consulting-Services-Analysis

## Business Objectives & User Stories

This project involved creating a Consulting Services Dashboard to provide an at-a-glance view of key metrics relevant to consulting sales performance. The dashboard was developed to address specific business needs identified by the sales and marketing team, focusing on tracking revenue, sales dynamics, customer engagement, and product performance. Below are the objectives and user requirements that guided the dashboard design.

### Business Objectives:
1. **Monitor Sales Performance**
Provide a clear overview of sales figures, including total revenue, number of sales, average revenue per sale, and average purchase frequency. The goal is to allow stakeholders to track overall sales performance and identify trends over time.
   
2. **Product Performance Analysis**
Highlight which consulting products are generating the highest revenue and most sales. This analysis will help the business determine which services are most profitable and where there may be opportunities for increased marketing efforts.
   
3. **Customer Engagement Tracking**
Track customer interaction metrics, such as the number of received, opened, and clicked emails, to understand engagement levels. This helps the marketing team evaluate the effectiveness of email campaigns and determine which products are receiving the most customer interest.

4. **Sales Dynamics Visualization**
Provide a monthly trend of sales and revenue to help the business understand seasonality and patterns in consulting services demand. This enables better forecasting and resource allocation.
